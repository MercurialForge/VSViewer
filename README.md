## [RoadMap](https://trello.com/b/nCwUxluj/vagrant-story-viewer)

This trello board is my acting roadmap. It shows known issues, and desired features. It also shows my completed content. It will also host links to stable releases in addition to this github repo.

## Motivation

Vagrant Story is without a doubt my favorite game of all time. I've beaten it at least once a year since 2000. I've owned two physical copies, and one digital copy. I've played it on PS1, PS2, PS3, PSP, and PSTV. I love this game, so when I found out about the hacking documentation and other people exploring the content and reverse engineering; I knew I had too as well.
